# robotogotchi
A JetBrain academy's project.
It is a simple Robot like algorithm that allows user to interact with a Robot (pet like). 
Upon running the robotogotchi.py file, user is asked to enter the name they want to give to their Robot and then provided
with different options which are the possible ways to interact with the Robot. 
The possible options are:
exit - This exits the program.

  - numbers
   - rock-paper-scissors \n
learn - This increases the Robot skills.
work - makes the Robot work
oil - Oils the Robot
sleep - Put the Robot to sleep
